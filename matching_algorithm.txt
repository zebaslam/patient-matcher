Matching Algorithm Description
=============================

This matching algorithm uses a hybrid approach that combines normalization, efficient filtering, and custom string similarity scoring. 
The goal is to identify probable internal patient records corresponding to external patient entries.

Preprocessing
-------------

- All fields are normalized:
  - Lowercased
  - Stripped of punctuation, whitespace, and special characters
  - Dates are standardized to YYYY-MM-DD
  - Phone numbers are reduced to digits only
  - Addresses remove suite/apartment/unit to simplify 
- To reduce unnecessary computation, we filter internal candidates based on:
  - Matching Date of Birth (exact match)
  - Matching Sex (exact match)
  Candidates failing either of these are excluded before further comparison.

Fields Used and Similarity Algorithms
-------------------------------------

Each field contributes a weighted similarity score. The algorithm used for each is chosen based on the field's characteristics:

  Field         | Weight | Algorithm                             | Justification
  --------------|--------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
  Date of Birth | 0.30   | Exact                                 | High confidence identifier; typos unlikely and unacceptable
  Last Name     | 0.15   | Jaro-Winkler                          | Tolerant of minor typos and transpositions; good for names
  First Name    | 0.15   | Custom: first_name_similarity         | Custom logic accounts for common nicknames and abbreviations
  Address       | 0.15   | Combined Jaccard + Levenshtein        | Captures structural and token similarity for complex strings
  Zip Code      | 0.10   | General similarity (Levenshtein)      | Small errors may occur; lenient edit-distance match helps
  Phone Number  | 0.05   | Custom: phone_similarity              | Accounts for missing area codes and minor digit issues
  City          | 0.05   | General similarity (Levenshtein)      | Simple field; typographical tolerance is sufficient
  Sex           | 0.05   | Exact                                 | Binary categorical; should match exactly

The total similarity score is computed as the weighted average of all individual field scores.

Match Selection
---------------

For each external patient:
- Each internal patient is compared using only critical fields: DOB and Sex
- If critical normalized fields match, the pair is considered a candidate
- The similarity score is calculated for each candidate using the weighted similarity function above
- The best-scoring internal patient is selected if their score exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 0.75)
- If no match passes the threshold, the external patient is excluded from the match results

Assumptions
-----------

- No shared unique IDs exist between datasets
- DOB and sex are treated as reliable identifiers and used for filtering
- Names, addresses, and phone numbers may contain typos, abbreviations, or formatting inconsistencies
- The matching process favors precision over recall, optimizing to minimize false positives
