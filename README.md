# Patient Roster Matching Web Application

This project is a local-only web application that matches patients from two datasets:

- `data/internal.csv` (internal hospital's patient roster)
- `data/external.csv` (external medical practice's roster)

The goal is to identify likely matches based on personal attributes like name, date of birth, address, etc., despite data inconsistencies.

### Requirements

- Python 3.11
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zebaslam/patient-matcher.git
cd patient-matcher
```

Alternatively,

Download zip file
Unzip attached zip file from email

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

## ðŸ§  Matching Algorithm Overview

The algorithm uses a **hybrid similarity approach**:

- **Normalization**: All strings are lowercased, punctuation and whitespace are removed, and phone numbers are reduced to digits only.
- **Pre-filtering**: To improve performance and avoid poor matches, internal patients are filtered to only those with the same **Date of Birth** and **Sex**.
- **Field-specific similarity**:
  - **First Name**: Custom nickname-aware similarity
  - **Last Name**: Jaro-Winkler
  - **Address**: Combined Jaccard + Levenshtein
  - **Phone Number**: Digit-aware phone similarity
  - **Zip Code**, **City**: Edit distance (Levenshtein)
  - **DOB, Sex**: Exact match

Each field is given a **weight** (from `config.json`), and a final score is computed as a weighted average of all field similarities.

A match is accepted if its score exceeds a defined threshold (defined in `config.json`). The best match per external patient is written to `matches.csv`.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- All string fields are stripped of punctuation and lowercased.
- Phone numbers are normalized to just digits (e.g., `"(555) 123-4567"` â†’ `"5551234567"`).
- Dates of birth are parsed and formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Token-based normalization is used for addresses to improve tolerance to reordering or punctuation differences.

---

## âœ… Assumptions and Simplifications

- **DOB** and **Sex** are reliable and used as hard filters.
- There is **no unique patient ID** shared between files.
- The matching algorithm prioritizes **precision over recall**, meaning it avoids false positives even if that leads to more unmatched rows.
- Only the **best match** per external patient is recorded in `matches.csv`; if no match passes the threshold, that patient is excluded.
